# anthocyanin-accumulation
MATLAB code used to process leaf images, train regressions, and evaluate regressions for accuracy.

BEFORE RUNNING CODE:
- remove background pixels from all images
- save each leaf as a separate '.png' file in a single folder

To replicate method 
sort_images.m

mean_color_index_values.m -> calculates mean color index values in 5 color spaces for images in a specified folder
