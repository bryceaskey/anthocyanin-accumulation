## Before running code:
- remove background pixels from all images
- save each leaf as a separate '.png' file in a single folder
- create a .csv file with columns for sample names (should match with image names) and their corresponding NAI

## Primary functions:
### main.R --
Calls all functions necessary for calculating mean color index values, sorting data into training/validation and test sets, training models, evaluating model accuracy, and heatmap generation with most accurate model.

## Appendix S1
A table containing RMSE, r^2, and MAE values for the 110 regressions tested. Regressions are sorted from lowest to highest RMSE.
